# RFM Model for Customer Segmentation using Power BI

My project used Power BI to analyze customer behavior with the RFM model, segmenting customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value metrics. Applying the RFM model aimed to identify high-value customers, improve customer loyalty, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance overall customer experience.

The insights gained from this project included:

1. Identification of high-value customers for targeted retention strategies.
2. Understanding customer behavior patterns to personalize marketing strategies and increase loyalty.
3. Optimization of marketing strategies by tailoring them to different RFM segments.
4. The project provided valuable information on customer segmentation, key customer identities, characteristics of different customer groups, and guiding marketing activities to boost customer experience and company profitability.
